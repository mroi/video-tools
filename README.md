Video Tools
===========

This is a compilation of a bunch of scripts and small helper tools that I use to process and 
manage movies and other media in iTunes style MPEG-4 format.

Among them are:

`aac_encode`
: Pipe in a 48kHz stereo s16le PCM stream. Uses QuickTime to convert to AAC.
`compare.sh`
: Compares MPEG-4 files with regard to the tracks they contain and their metadata.
`dolby_decode.sh`
: Upmixes Dolby ProLogic Surround audio to 5.1. Eats 48kHz stereo s16le PCM, outputs same 
: with six channels in standard L-R-C-LFE-Ls-Rs layout.
`encode.sh`
: The main thing. Takes anything HandBrake understands and encodes to canonical iTunes style 
: MPEG-4.

The scripts need a couple of tools along their way. You can place them right here into the 
project directory, because this will be in `$PATH`. The `Makefile` will help you collect 
everything needed.
